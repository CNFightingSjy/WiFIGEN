# Vision Reimagined: AI-Powered Breakthroughs in WiFi Indoor Imaging

> This is the first research work to consider WiFi indoor imaging as a multi-modal image generation task that converts the measured WiFi power into a high-resolution indoor image. 
Our proposed WiFi-GEN network achieves a shape reconstruction accuracy that is 275\% of that achieved by physical model-based inversion methods.
To examine the effectiveness of models for this task, the first large-scale dataset is released containing 80,000 pairs of WiFi signal and imaging target.
Our model absorbs challenges for the model-based methods including the non-linearity, ill-posedness and non-certainty into massive parameters of our generative AI network. 
The network is also designed to best fit measured WiFi signals and the desired imaging output.
